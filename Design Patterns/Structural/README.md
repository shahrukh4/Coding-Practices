### Facade Pattern

- This pattern is used to provide a single point of access to a complex system or a set of related objects.
- We can use this pattern when there are lot of interrelated things are going on and that can be managed by only one class.
- For e.g. Hotels (Rooms, Food, Laundry), Airlines (Flights, Meals, Spa), Banks (Accounts, Cheques, Loans).
